# Project Overview

This repository contains code, data, and results for a simulation-based project focused on preprocessing, feature extraction, model experiments, and classification tasks. The project involves simulations using background images and test tanks, with results visualized through generated images.

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

### 1. `Code/`
- Contains all the Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks used for preprocessing data, feature extraction, and running machine learning experiments.
- Includes:
  - Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Code for feature extraction.
  - Implementation of various models (e.g., classification models).

### 2. `backgrounds/`
- Contains image files used as backgrounds in the simulation.
- These images serve as the environment for the simulation scenarios.

### 3. `results/`
- Includes visual outputs and results from the simulation and model experiments.
- Contains images and other artifacts generated during the simulation and analysis.

### 4. `test_tanks/`
- Holds image files representing test tanks used in the simulation.
- These tanks are key components of the simulation setup.
