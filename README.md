Project Overview
This repository contains code, data, and results for a simulation-based project focused on preprocessing, feature extraction, model experiments, and classification tasks. The project involves simulations using background images and test tanks, with results visualized through generated images.

Directory Structure
The repository is organized into the following folders and files:

Code
Contains all the Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks used for preprocessing data, feature extraction, and running machine learning experiments.
Includes:
Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing.
Code for feature extraction.
Implementation of various models (e.g., classification models).
backgrounds
Contains image files used as backgrounds in the simulation.
These images serve as the environment for the simulation scenarios.
results
Includes visual outputs and results from the simulation and model experiments.
Contains images and other artifacts generated during the simulation and analysis.
test_tanks
Holds image files representing test tanks used in the simulation.
These tanks are key components of the simulation setup.
Capstone_simple_simulation.ipynb
A Jupyter Notebook containing the simulation code.
Note: This notebook cannot be previewed directly on GitHub due to its size or complexity. Users must download it to run locally.
